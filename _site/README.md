 # simple-staticman-site
This repo exists for me to test changes to the Staticman API as well as to play with features before adding them to my [personal site](https://waibel.us)

The current master branch is hosted on github pages [here](https://waibel.us/simple-staticman-site).

### Templates
This repo also serves as a reference for several templates on the other branches.

* staticman-example-site
    * This branch contains a minimal working example of using Staticman to provide comments to Jekyll pages. It uses a slightly modified version of the default Jekyll theme, [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
* template-site
    * This branch is a minimal working configuration for Jekyll with GitHub Pages and contains no Staticman related code.
